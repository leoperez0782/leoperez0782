# HiðŸ‘‹ I am Leonardo PÃ©rez, a computer analyst and programmer :man_technologist:

I am not currently working as a developer. I recently got my degree and am now looking for a developer position.
I love Dart and Flutter, I also like Java and Javascript, although the language is just a tool, so I am willing to learn more. I am trying to make a portfolio, as you can see it is under construction. Hope when it's done, you really enjoy it.

###Personal interests

Since life is not just programming, I am going to tell you some of my hobbies:
I like kayaking and the practice of yoga and meditation :lotus_position: . I love my dog :dog: and to see a nice sunset from the seashore.
